        <p><strong>1. Do false cases get resolved quickly?</strong></p>
        <p>No. The genuineness of a case has no effect on how quickly it reaches resolution.</p>
        <p><strong>Two strongest factors</strong> that quicken case conclusion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear-cut, solid evidence</li>
            <li>Better advocates</li>

        <p><strong>2. TheNewsMinute article on false cases by Geetika Mantri</strong></p>
        <p>This article, which claims that false cases are rare, presents 2020 NCRB data that is confined to a few categories under police disposal.</p>
            <p>It lacks proper research on terminology and <b>assumes that false cases only fall under FRF</b>.</p>
            <p>It <b>includes cases from previous years under investigation</b> into the whole set of data, but includes only cases closed as FRF in 2020 as false.</p>
            <p>It goes on to make a biased statistical interpretation that every other case including cases concluded with insufficient evidence involve true incidents, whereas they are actually unknown sets of data that can, at best, be estimated based on cases with solid conclusion as to whether the reported event happened or not.</p>
            <p><b>Withdrawn cases</b> are mistakenly assumed to come under FRF, when they are actually categorized in a dedicated column <b>in court disposal data</b> in NCRB reports. <b>Final reports are not filed for withdrawn complaints.</b></p>
            <p>Under the subheading <b>‘Misuse’ and how it really happens</b>, it starts off with "we don’t know why the final report concluded it was a false allegation". Any police officer can clarify why. The CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) does not allow such final reports without proper investigation, and requires approval from the court.</p>
        <p>The article in question has interpreted the data through a strong lens of confirmation bias.</p>
